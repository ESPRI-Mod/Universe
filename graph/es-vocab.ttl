Simulations with different simulation lengths by a single model are treated as members of an ensemble. Thus, different 'realization' indexes (e.g., r1, r2, r3, ...) should be used in a global attribute named 'variant_index' (e.g., r1i1p1f1). It is requested that information relevant to understanding the differences in members of an ensemble of simulations is reported in a global attribute named 'variant_info'.
